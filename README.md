# Emotion-Classification
Formative Assessment: NLP - Emotion Classification in Text

To develop machine learning models to classify emotions in text samples, I'll go through the following steps:

Loading and Preprocessing

Feature Extraction

Model Development

Model Comparison

Step 1: Loading and Preprocessing First, load the dataset and inspect it. Then, clean the text, tokenize it, and remove stopwords.

Loading the Dataset I will load the dataset from the provided link and check its structure. For demonstration purposes, let's assume the dataset has columns like text and emotion.

Preprocessing Techniques Text Cleaning: Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters. 
Tokenization: Splitting text into words (tokens). 
Stopwords Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to the meaning . 
Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their base form Impact on Model Performance Text Cleaning ensures that noise is reduced in the text data, leading to better feature extraction. 
Tokenization converts text into a format suitable for feature extraction. 
Stopwords Removal reduces the dimensionality of the text data and focuses on meaningful words. 
Lemmatization/Stemming helps in normalizing words, reducing redundancy, and improving model accuracy. 

Step 2: Feature Extraction Use CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features.

CountVectorizer: Converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts. TfidfVectorizer: Converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features. The choice of vectorizer impacts the performance as TfidfVectorizer tends to give more importance to rare words and downweights common words.

Step 3: Model Development I will train two models:

Naive Bayes: Suitable for text classification due to its simplicity and effectiveness. 

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective in high-dimensional spaces and commonly used for text classification. 

Step 4: Model Comparison I will evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
